# Understanding Brexit: Factors Influencing Voting Behaviour and Regional Support Through Multilevel Modelling
In the 2016 EU referendum, results were not released by individual constituencies, but many are interested in understanding the reasons behind the vote to leave and how the support varied across constituencies. This research, therefore, investigates the factors leading to voting behaviour in Brexit and examines the variation in support across constituencies. This study will be based on the existing literature about factors influencing the Brexit vote and provide new insights by applying multilevel modelling to different datasets, aiming to explain how individual and geographical factors influence the probability of voting to leave the European Union (EU). Understanding the factors behind Brexit is crucial, as this historic and unprecedented event is expected to have significant and long-lasting political and economic consequences, not only for the UK but for the entire EU (Hobolt, 2016; Kierzenkowski et al., 2016; Sampson, 2017). Identifying these factors will also provide valuable insights into the behaviour of voters and broader social dynamics, hence informing future policy decisions and offering a deeper understanding of the evolving political landscape.
