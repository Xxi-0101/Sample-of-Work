# Understanding Brexit: Factors Influencing Voting Behaviour and Regional Support Through Multilevel Modelling
In the 2016 EU referendum, results were not released by individual constituencies, but many are interested in understanding the reasons behind the vote to leave and how support varied across regions. Therefore, this research aims to explore the factors influencing voting behaviour for Brexit and examine the variation in support across constituencies. This research will build upon existing literature about factors influencing the Brexit vote and provide new insights by applying multilevel modelling to different datasets, aiming to explain how individual and geographical factors influence the probability of voting to leave the European Union (EU). Understanding the factors behind Brexit is crucial, as this historic and unprecedented event is expected to have significant and lasting political and economic consequences, not only for the UK but for the entire EU (Hobolt, 2016; Kierzenkowski et al., 2016; Sampson, 2017). Identifying these factors will also provide valuable insights into voter behaviour and the broader social dynamics, informing future policy decisions and offering a deeper understanding of the evolving political landscape.
